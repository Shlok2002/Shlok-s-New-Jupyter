<p>I am an undergraduate student at Shiv Nadar Institution of Eminence majoring in electrical and electronics engineering. At university, I research modern machine learning algorithms for applications in content creation, finance, and energy analytics. I enjoy performing exploratory data analyses on public data sets and creating beautiful and intuitive visualisations. I am interested in leveraging the power of data to solve complex business problems in renewable energy and green finance.</p>

<p>I have a diverse portfolio of work experiences in technical, business and marketing segments from my internships. I thrive in entrepreneurial environments collaborating with cross-functional and dynamic teams, solving complex problems.</p>
