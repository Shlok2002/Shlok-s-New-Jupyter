Investment is a similar skill that requires precise planning and execution. The decisions you make today have a significant impact on your future returns. The easiest way to ease this panning process is by investing via mutual funds. A mutual fund is a financial instrument wherein capital from many investors is pooled to form an investment product. The fund manager then supports across financial instruments to realise the fund’s investment goal. Check out this blog to choose the best mutual funds! Equity mutual funds are an excellent way to generate long-term, inflation-beating returns.\nLong-term wealth creation is not a linear process. There are multiple ups and downs along the journey. These events can sometimes span for several months or even years. It is of utmost importance to have an asset that is seldom influenced by the market and acts as an excellent store of value. Tis Gold!\nSeasoned investors have always regarded gold as a safe-haven asset. It has an excellent store of value and often acts as a hedge against inflation. However, physical gold has its limitations;\n\nIt is not readily liquid\nIt is prone to theft and damage\nInitial investing value is very high\n\nDigital Gold is an online Gold alternative which enables you to hold gold virtually without owning a safe or bank locker. The seller keeps an equivalent weight of physical gold in a secure vault for each online purchase.\nInsurance is another financial instrument that is a must-have in your plan. It offers you a protective financial cover against the various contingencies in life. For the many uncertainties that life throws your way, there are different types of insurance that you can bank on. Primarily, insurance for individuals is categorised as Life Insurance and General Insurance. Life Insurance offers a cover on the life of the policyholder. General Insurance, on the other hand, comes in many different forms. Motor Insurance for your vehicles, Home Insurance for your house, and even Travel Insurance for your vacations or business travels. And most importantly, there’s Health Insurance, which offers you a bankable cover for medical emergencies."

    "text": "What is an NFT?\nNFT stands for Non-Fungible-Token; non-fungible means something that cannot be exchanged for an item because it is unique. In other words, you can exchange a ₹100 note for another ₹100 note as both have the same value associated with them. Another classic example is a cryptocurrency; 1 Bitcoin can be exchanged for another. Cryptocurrency is fungible, whereas NFTs are not. On the other hand, one piece of artwork is not equal to another; The Mona Lisa is not equal to a Van Gogh’s since both have unique properties. NFTs are tokens that live on a blockchain and represent ownership of unique items. Why do you need a blockchain to do this? Well, tracking a digital file is tricky, as it can be copied and distributed effortlessly. A blockchain comes in handy for ease of tracking ownership and for the value discovery of an asset. Let us take an example to cement our understanding.\nSuppose you made a piece of digital art. You can create a .jpg or mint an NFT out of this. The NFT that represents your art contains information about it, such as\n\nA unique fingerprint ID of the file (Hash)\nToken Name\nToken Symbol\n\nThis token is then stored on the blockchain, and you, the artist, become the owner. To sell the artwork, you create a transaction on the blockchain, and the blockchain makes sure that this information can never be tampered with. It also allows you to track the current owner if the artwork is traded further. In other words, it is a smart contract on the blockchain that stores the unique properties of the asset and keeps track of current and previous owners."

    "text": "What is Hydrogen?\nHydrogen (H2) is the lightest and smallest element on the periodic table. It can be used for clean burning, zero emission fuel to store and harness energy. Hydrogen has many different use cases as it is both versatile and transportable. Currently, Hydrogen is used not only as a fuel and storage of energy, but also as a feedstock/raw material in machine or industrial processes.\nSource: Australia's Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization (CSIRO): National Hydrogen Roadmap\nHeat uses: Hydrogen can be used as a source of heat for industrial sectors such as steel, cement, aluminum, paper and building either directly or by blending hydrogen with natural gas to reduce carbon emissions. However, there are some cost challenges for Hydrogen's commercial viability, the carbon prices would still need to be raised to $50–60/tCO2eq for industries like steel and cement and to $160/tCO2eq for space and water heating up to the year 2050 .\nFeedstock uses: Industry chemicals such as plastics, fertilizers and fuel refining and products such as iron, steel, glass, metallurgy, and agriculture require raw materials/feedstock that usually comes from fossil fuels as a part of manufacturing lifecycle and hydrogen could be an alternative.\nFuel uses: Long distance vehicles such as trucks, ships, and airplanes, where the electric battery vehicle technology has faced limitations, could leverage hydrogen powered fuel cell vehicles.\nHydrogen could be used as a source of power by being re-electrified but low levels of efficiency make this type of use case less appealing in the past. Due to recent technological advancements, Hydrogen now has the potential for longer-duration storage of energy, in addition to the flexibility to convert back to electricity if required. Nevertheless, hydrogen cannot currently unlock some sectors, such as long-distance transport pertaining to electrification.\nIn the case of green hydrogen, excess renewable energy that would otherwise have been curtailed (e.g., excess solar energy during the middle of the day) can be stored as hydrogen and released as energy later when required. This enables the ability to store solar energy from the summer to winter months or be used in periods of peak electricity demand.\nAdditionally, the US National Grid has recently secured $12.45 million in funding from the US Department of Energy (DOE) to facilitate research and accelerate the potential of hydrogen blending in its gas networks as a pathway to net carbon zero goal .\nThe global space propulsion market is projected to grow from USD 6.7 billion in 2020 to USD 14.2 billion by 2025, at a CAGR of 16.2% from 2020 to 2025. Similarly, the global hydrogen fuel cell market is forecast to reach USD 848 million by 2025 from an estimated value of USD 263 million in 2020, growing at a CAGR of 26.4% during the forecast period.\nNASA for example has long been relying on hydrogen as the primary rocket fuel for its space exploration activities — delivery of crew and cargo to space (Centaur, Apollo, and other space shuttle vehicles). From these use cases, NASA has both demonstrated and developed extensive experience in the safe and effective handling of hydrogen. Typically, about 500,000 gallons of cold liquid hydrogen (LH2) is needed for the rocket engines of each. The United Launch Alliance (ULA) Atlas Centaur stage rocket, Boeing's Delta III and IV rockets, and Blue Origin's BE-3 and BE-7 engines all use LH2 rocket fuel.\nSource: MarketsandMarkets Research Private Ltd\nIn September 2020, Airbus announced three concepts for the world's first zero-emission (ZEROe) commercial aircraft which could be ready by 2035. All these concepts depend on hydrogen as a primary power source to be a solution for aerospace and many other industries to meet their climate-neutral targets. All three concepts utilize liquid hydrogen fuel to power modified gas turbine aircraft engines. These concepts consist of a set of different approaches to achieve zero-emission flight by exploring various technology pathways and aerodynamic configurations for the decarbonization of the entire aviation industry. The first concept has hydrogen turbofans providing lift for up to 200 passengers with a range of 2,000+ miles. The second concept revolves around a smaller hydrogen turboprop design to carry up to 100 passengers with a range of 1,000+ miles. The third concept is to configure a bold blended-wing body design that offers enhanced flexibility for hydrogen storage and distribution as well as cabin layout .\nNevertheless, the airports will require significant hydrogen transport and refueling infrastructure to meet the needs of day-to-day operations from an infrastructure perspective. Government subsidies and support will be key to further advance the use of sustainable fuels and the renewal of aircraft fleets to allow airlines to retire older, less environmentally friendly aircraft earlier.\nIn addition, the widespread viability of hydrogen for global commercial uses depends on the following factors:\n\nPublic Perception — safety concerns over the usage of hydrogen as it is a highly flammable gas with the heightened risk of explosions. However, the largest addressable focus markets for clean hydrogen are for industrial uses that are hard to electrify and are not consumer-facing.\nTransportation — hydrogen is a low-density gas, which means that the volume to transport the same amount of energy is much higher than natural gas for example. Hence, the higher volumes result in much higher costs for transportation without retrofitting the existing networks of pipe systems used for natural gas. It poses a serious threat for oversea export/import logistics of the gas from cheaper places like Australia to in demand areas such as Japan.\nProduction Cost — fossil fuels can be extracted from earth, but hydrogen must be produced. Hence, the cost of production will take a long time to be cost-competitive and are likely to remain higher unless governments push initiatives such as — strict policies, incentive programs, subsidies, and carbon prices to become the norm .\nInfrastructure — while hydrogen can be used with some existing infrastructure (e.g., gas pipelines), there needs to be significant investments pertaining to infrastructure upgrades."

It is projected to reach nearly 300 mt in 2050.\nCurrently, hydrogen is mainly produced via reforming of natural gas, and the hydrogen is called \"gray\" hydrogen because it is derived from fossil fuels. The process emits up to 2% of total CO2 emission in the world, and because of the higher expectation of hydrogen as a next energy source, a demand for more cleaner ways of producing hydrogen is increasing. If carbon dioxide emitted from the \"gray\" hydrogen production process gets captured before it is released to the atmosphere, the hydrogen is called \"blue\". Nowadays, \"green\" hydrogen has attracted many players; \"green\" hydrogen uses renewable energy to electrolyze water to split hydrogen and oxygen. Now the production cost of grey hydrogen is $1/kg, and the cost of green hydrogen is $3–7.5lkg. Since the cost of renewable energy is getting lower, there is a prediction that the cost of green hydrogen could go down to $2/kg.\n\nMost often this compound is water, which is divided into hydrogen and oxygen.\nIf the electricity used comes from renewable sources, like wind and solar, the subsequent hydrogen is known as \"green.\"\nAccording to the International Energy Agency, less than 0.1% of hydrogen today is produced through water electrolysis, but that could soon change.\nMost of the hydrogen today is used in industry, including oil refining and the production of ammonia, methanol, and steel. But recent advancements in green hydrogen technology are making it much more appealing for several different industries."

Right now, it costs $3–7 per kilogram to produce, compared with $1 per kilogram when made with fossil fuels. But three critical factors have aligned in the last year to make it possible to bring that production cost down to between $1 and $2 by 2050.\nFirst, the cost of electrolyzes used to create hydrogen have dropped 50% in the last five years and are expected to fall at least another 60%-90% by 2030, which can start to make green hydrogen competitive to the gray hydrogen used in industries today.7 Falling renewable prices are also key to bringing down hydrogen costs: 60–75% of green hydrogen costs from electricity.\nSeeing technological advances that should further reduce costs by increasing production efficiency and the flexibility of green hydrogen use in fuel cells.\n\n\n\nRegulation\nGovernments across the globe are buying into green hydrogen, which is the most critical incentive for the green hydrogen economy.\n\nIn July 2021, the European Union made its European Hydrogen Strategy the centerpiece of its Green Deal, which in turn was folded into its fiscal stimulus response to the pandemic.\nThe Green Deal is tremendously ambitious and provides an instant source of demand, which is bound to be a catalyst for further innovation and cost reduction, not to mention enormous infrastructure development.\n\nEurope isn't the only place thinking along these lines. Australia, Japan, China, the UK, and Korea all have green hydrogen strategies and/or targets. Sectors we think could be clear beneficiaries include renewable energy, given that demand is likely to grow 10 times by 2050 to service the needs of green hydrogen alone. Utilities will play a role in converting gas grids so that they can carry hydrogen blended with natural gas. Companies that develop electrolyzes and fuel cells stand to benefit, and the chemicals and industrial gases industry is likely to play a large role, given its expertise in using and transporting hydrogen."

    "text": "Based on Investment Goals\n\nGrowth Funds: Funds that invest primarily in high-performing stocks with the aim of capital appreciation are considered growth funds. These funds can be an attractive option for investors seeking high returns over a long period. E.g., Mirae Asset Emerging Bluechip Fund\nTax Saving Funds: Equity-linked saving schemes are mutual funds that invest primarily in company securities. However, they qualify for tax deductions under Section 80C of the Income Tax Act. They have a minimum investment horizon of three years. E.g., L&T Tax Advantage Fund\nCapital Protection Funds: These funds invest partially in fixed income instruments and into equities. This could ensure capital protection, i.e., minimal loss, if any. However, returns are taxable. E.g., SBI CPO Fund"

    "text": "Based on Risk Appetite\n\nVery Low-Risk Funds: Liquid and ultra-short duration funds are considered very-low risk funds. Their returns are low (6% at best). Investors usually park their surplus cash in such funds until they find better investment opportunities. E.g.: Nippon India Ultra Short Duration Fund\nLow-risk Funds: Arbitrage funds are considered low-risk funds. They have minimal exposure to equities and high-risk asset classes. These are best suited for risk-averse investors, and again the returns are 6-8% on average. Eg: Tata Arbitrage Fund\nMedium-Risk Funds: Such funds have considerable exposure to equities. These funds are very similar to index funds and give moderate returns in the range of 9-12% E.g., Kotak Savings Funds\nHigh-Risk Funds: These funds have maximum stock exposure (>95%). The NAV for these funds is volatile too. Moreover, these funds are best suited for young people who have a higher risk appetite. Returns are upwards of 15%, often beating the indexes they track. Some funds also give returns of above 20% E.g., Quant small-cap funds"

If investors want to leverage sectoral trends, they can invest via this route. E.g., BOI AXA Manufacturing & Infrastructure Fund\nIndex Funds: These are passive funds with very low expense ratios. They track an index and invest according to the constituents of the same. They are great for investors seeking moderate returns. They may or may not beat the index. E.g., UTI Nifty Index Fund\nFund of Funds: These are special mutual funds that invest in units of other mutual funds. Most global funds available in India are of this type. In short, you are buying a fund that invests in additional diverse funds. E.g., ICICI Prudential Asset Allocator Fund (FoF)\nInternational Funds: These funds invest in companies outside India. Investors seeking international exposure may consider these funds. E.g., Motilal Oswal S&P 500 Index Fund\nExchange-Traded Funds: These belong to the index fund family. They are close-ended and trade on the exchanges. They give exposure to broader markets as well as specific sectors. E.g., SBI Nifty IT ETF"

    "text": "FAQs\nWhat are regular and direct options in mutual funds?\nWhen one invests via a mutual fund distributor, one invests in regular funds. Regular funds tend to have a higher expense ratio to compensate for the commission paid by the AMC to the distributor. On the other hand, direct plans have a lower expense ratio as there is no intermediary; you engage directly with the fund house. If you invest via your financial advisor, a regular plan suits you; otherwise, a direct plan is much better to reduce expenses.\nAre returns guaranteed in mutual funds?\nMost AMC has a disclosure that the fund may fail to achieve its goals, and hence one should perform proper due diligence before investing.\nWhat is the IDCW option in funds?\nIDCW stands for Income Distribution cum Withdrawal. These are plans where the AMC periodically distributes profit to its unitholders via the declaration of annual dividends. These are suitable for people looking for a regular income stream from their investments."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Gold has been a reliable investment option and a symbol of wealth since ages, getting passed on from mothers and grandmothers down to the younger generations. It is believed that all of the gold present in the earth's crust has been mined; there is very little possibility of finding more reserves of this metal and hence it is deemed to be precious. All the gold available to us today is in circulation and hence there is no 'store' from which 'new' gold can be added into circulation. This has resulted in gold having tremendous store value and hence is considered very stable in terms of its returns.\nDigital Gold is the new, and much more efficient iteration of storing this lustrous asset. This risk-free, storage-proof investment instrument is a perfect blend of both technology and the traditional importance Gold has."

    "text": "What is Digital Gold?\nBefore going any further, it's important to cover this question. Digital gold is an online Gold alternative which enables you to hold gold virtually without owning a safe or bank locker. The seller keeps an equivalent weight of physical gold in a secure vault for each online purchase.\nBenefits of Adopting Digital Gold\n\nTaxation: Returns on digital gold assets held for less than 36 months are not strictly taxable. In the case of long-term capital gains, one would have to pay a 20 percent tax on the whole amount, plus a surcharge and a 4% cess with indexation benefits. This is great for investors who want to build an emergency fund in the short to medium term.\nStorage: One does not have to pay bank locker rent, insurance cover or additional investment of Fixed Deposit (FD). The seller promises that the digital gold is stored in an insured, secured vault at no extra cost.\nLiquidity: Digital gold can be sold or redeemed at the click of a button. You can sell the digital gold instantly and the value of your gold is instantly transferred into your bank account through a 24x7 market-linked rate.\nPortfolio Diversification: It is a good investment option for portfolio diversification and a good hedge asset. Making charges: Gold in jewellery form attracts at least 8%, making charges and the price of gold while buying it. This increases the buying cost and depreciation of returns; thus, investors now tend to buy digital gold free from any form of making charges.\nInvest in small amounts: There is no minimum threshold to buy digital gold. One can start investing with as low as INR 10. This surely helps in accumulating assets over a long period of time.\n\nDigital gold is the perfect instrument to begin your investment journey. It is a great way to create robust long-term wealth. One can invest in fractions as low as INR 10 and there is no cap on your investment too."
