Planning begins with a thorough evaluation of the person’s current financial state and future expectations and may be created independently or with the help of a certified financial planner."

    "text": "Where should I invest?\nWhen planning for the future, choosing a suitable asset class is work half done. Planning and execution is a lifelong skill and takes years to master. Investment is a similar skill that requires precise planning and execution. The decisions you make today have a significant impact on your future returns. The easiest way to ease this panning process is by investing via mutual funds. A mutual fund is a financial instrument wherein capital from many investors is pooled to form an investment product. The fund manager then supports across financial instruments to realise the fund’s investment goal. Check out this blog to choose the best mutual funds! Equity mutual funds are an excellent way to generate long-term, inflation-beating returns.\nLong-term wealth creation is not a linear process. There are multiple ups and downs along the journey. These events can sometimes span for several months or even years. It is of utmost importance to have an asset that is seldom influenced by the market and acts as an excellent store of value. Tis Gold!\nSeasoned investors have always regarded gold as a safe-haven asset. It has an excellent store of value and often acts as a hedge against inflation. However, physical gold has its limitations;\n\nIt is not readily liquid\nIt is prone to theft and damage\nInitial investing value is very high\n\nDigital Gold is an online Gold alternative which enables you to hold gold virtually without owning a safe or bank locker. The seller keeps an equivalent weight of physical gold in a secure vault for each online purchase.\nInsurance is another financial instrument that is a must-have in your plan. It offers you a protective financial cover against the various contingencies in life. For the many uncertainties that life throws your way, there are different types of insurance that you can bank on. Primarily, insurance for individuals is categorised as Life Insurance and General Insurance. Life Insurance offers a cover on the life of the policyholder. General Insurance, on the other hand, comes in many different forms. Motor Insurance for your vehicles, Home Insurance for your house, and even Travel Insurance for your vacations or business travels. And most importantly, there’s Health Insurance, which offers you a bankable cover for medical emergencies."

    "text": "What is Factor Investing?\nFactor investing is designed to enhance diversification, generate above-market returns and manage risk. Portfolio diversification has long been a popular safety tactic, but diversification gains are lost if the chosen securities move in lockstep with the broader market. For example, an investor may select a mixture of stocks and bonds that all decline in value when certain market conditions arise. The good news is factor investing can offset potential risks by targeting broad, persistent, and long-recognized drivers of returns."

Focusing on one factor at a time can help simplify the analysis process for investors who might otherwise get overwhelmed by thousands of fundamental and technical analysis metrics for each stock.\nDiversified approach: Finally, different factors can have a relatively low correlation, allowing investors to potentially reduce their portfolios’ overall risk and volatility by diversifying based on several factors."

    "text": "Cons of factor Investing\n\nLonger-term approach: Factor investing is a long-term strategy; investors shouldn’t necessarily expect outperformance over months or even years. In fact, it can take several years to even test a potential factor as a viable investment strategy. Just because a factor has worked in the past doesn’t mean it will continue to work in the future.\nPotential bias: Factor investors can also be prone to selection bias. If you back-test enough factors for outperformance, you will eventually find factors that have generated positive historical results simply by chance.\nUnknown risks: Finally, correlations among different factors change over time, potentially creating more risk in a multifactor portfolio than investors realize."

E.g., All funds that are not listed on the exchanges.\nClose-Ended Funds: The unit capital to invest is pre-defined in closed-ended funds. The fund company cannot sell more than the pre-agreed number of units. To facilitate liquidity, these funds trade on stock exchanges. E.g., Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs)\nInterval Funds: These are a mixture of both open-ended and close-ended schemes. These funds are open for purchase or redemption only during specific intervals (decided by the fund houses) and are closed the rest of the time. They also have a lock-in period of two years after the initial purchase. These funds are predominantly debt-oriented. E.g. IDFC Yearly Series Interval Fund."

The gains and losses associated with these funds depend solely on how the invested shares perform in the stock market. E.g.: Axis Bluechip Fund\nDebt Funds: They invest in various fixed income instruments such as Fixed Maturity Plans (FMPs), Gilt Funds, Liquid Funds, Short-Term Plans, Long-Term Bonds and Monthly Income Plans, among others. Great for investors looking for passive income over fixed durations. E.g.: Aditya Birla Sun Life Liquid Fund\nHybrid Funds: As the name suggests, Hybrid or Balanced Funds are an optimum mix of bonds and stocks, thereby bridging the gap between equity funds and debt funds. The ratio can either be variable or fixed. E.g.: Kotak Equity Hybrid Fund"

However, they qualify for tax deductions under Section 80C of the Income Tax Act. They have a minimum investment horizon of three years. E.g., L&T Tax Advantage Fund\nCapital Protection Funds: These funds invest partially in fixed income instruments and into equities. This could ensure capital protection, i.e., minimal loss, if any.

Investors usually park their surplus cash in such funds until they find better investment opportunities. E.g.: Nippon India Ultra Short Duration Fund\nLow-risk Funds: Arbitrage funds are considered low-risk funds. They have minimal exposure to equities and high-risk asset classes. These are best suited for risk-averse investors, and again the returns are 6-8% on average. Eg: Tata Arbitrage Fund\nMedium-Risk Funds: Such funds have considerable exposure to equities. These funds are very similar to index funds and give moderate returns in the range of 9-12% E.g., Kotak Savings Funds\nHigh-Risk Funds: These funds have maximum stock exposure (>95%). The NAV for these funds is volatile too. Moreover, these funds are best suited for young people who have a higher risk appetite. Returns are upwards of 15%, often beating the indexes they track. Some funds also give returns of above 20% E.g., Quant small-cap funds"

They track an index and invest according to the constituents of the same. They are great for investors seeking moderate returns. They may or may not beat the index. E.g., UTI Nifty Index Fund\nFund of Funds: These are special mutual funds that invest in units of other mutual funds. Most global funds available in India are of this type. In short, you are buying a fund that invests in additional diverse funds. E.g., ICICI Prudential Asset Allocator Fund (FoF)\nInternational Funds: These funds invest in companies outside India. Investors seeking international exposure may consider these funds. E.g., Motilal Oswal S&P 500 Index Fund\nExchange-Traded Funds: These belong to the index fund family. They are close-ended and trade on the exchanges. They give exposure to broader markets as well as specific sectors. E.g., SBI Nifty IT ETF"

If you invest via your financial advisor, a regular plan suits you; otherwise, a direct plan is much better to reduce expenses.\nAre returns guaranteed in mutual funds?\nMost AMC has a disclosure that the fund may fail to achieve its goals, and hence one should perform proper due diligence before investing.\nWhat is the IDCW option in funds?\nIDCW stands for Income Distribution cum Withdrawal. These are plans where the AMC periodically distributes profit to its unitholders via the declaration of annual dividends.

It is believed that all of the gold present in the earth's crust has been mined; there is very little possibility of finding more reserves of this metal and hence it is deemed to be precious. All the gold available to us today is in circulation and hence there is no 'store' from which 'new' gold can be added into circulation. This has resulted in gold having tremendous store value and hence is considered very stable in terms of its returns.\nDigital Gold is the new, and much more efficient iteration of storing this lustrous asset.

Digital gold is an online Gold alternative which enables you to hold gold virtually without owning a safe or bank locker. The seller keeps an equivalent weight of physical gold in a secure vault for each online purchase.\nBenefits of Adopting Digital Gold\n\nTaxation: Returns on digital gold assets held for less than 36 months are not strictly taxable. In the case of long-term capital gains, one would have to pay a 20 percent tax on the whole amount, plus a surcharge and a 4% cess with indexation benefits. This is great for investors who want to build an emergency fund in the short to medium term.\nStorage: One does not have to pay bank locker rent, insurance cover or additional investment of Fixed Deposit (FD). The seller promises that the digital gold is stored in an insured, secured vault at no extra cost.\nLiquidity: Digital gold can be sold or redeemed at the click of a button. You can sell the digital gold instantly and the value of your gold is instantly transferred into your bank account through a 24x7 market-linked rate.\nPortfolio Diversification: It is a good investment option for portfolio diversification and a good hedge asset. Making charges: Gold in jewellery form attracts at least 8%, making charges and the price of gold while buying it. This increases the buying cost and depreciation of returns; thus, investors now tend to buy digital gold free from any form of making charges.\nInvest in small amounts: There is no minimum threshold to buy digital gold. One can start investing with as low as INR 10. This surely helps in accumulating assets over a long period of time.\n\nDigital gold is the perfect instrument to begin your investment journey. It is a great way to create robust long-term wealth. One can invest in fractions as low as INR 10 and there is no cap on your investment too."
