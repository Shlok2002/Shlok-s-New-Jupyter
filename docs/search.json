    "text": "Where should I invest?\nWhen planning for the future, choosing a suitable asset class is work half done. Planning and execution is a lifelong skill and takes years to master. Investment is a similar skill that requires precise planning and execution. The decisions you make today have a significant impact on your future returns. The easiest way to ease this panning process is by investing via mutual funds. A mutual fund is a financial instrument wherein capital from many investors is pooled to form an investment product. The fund manager then supports across financial instruments to realise the fund’s investment goal. Check out this blog to choose the best mutual funds! Equity mutual funds are an excellent way to generate long-term, inflation-beating returns.\nLong-term wealth creation is not a linear process. There are multiple ups and downs along the journey. These events can sometimes span for several months or even years. It is of utmost importance to have an asset that is seldom influenced by the market and acts as an excellent store of value. Tis Gold!\nSeasoned investors have always regarded gold as a safe-haven asset. It has an excellent store of value and often acts as a hedge against inflation. However, physical gold has its limitations;\n\nIt is not readily liquid\nIt is prone to theft and damage\nInitial investing value is very high\n\nDigital Gold is an online Gold alternative which enables you to hold gold virtually without owning a safe or bank locker. The seller keeps an equivalent weight of physical gold in a secure vault for each online purchase.\nInsurance is another financial instrument that is a must-have in your plan. It offers you a protective financial cover against the various contingencies in life. For the many uncertainties that life throws your way, there are different types of insurance that you can bank on. Primarily, insurance for individuals is categorised as Life Insurance and General Insurance. Life Insurance offers a cover on the life of the policyholder. General Insurance, on the other hand, comes in many different forms. Motor Insurance for your vehicles, Home Insurance for your house, and even Travel Insurance for your vacations or business travels. And most importantly, there’s Health Insurance, which offers you a bankable cover for medical emergencies."

    "section": "How to analyse an IPO",
    "text": "How to analyse an IPO\nBehind every IPO, there is a company that has a legitimate business. When you buy shares, you buy a part of that business. Analysing a business may be complex, but having a basic outline to analyse IPOs is a must for investors seeking to invest in them. Following are the things to take notice of while exploring IPOs\n\nType of Issue\nReason for IPO\nPerformance of the company\nSubscription of the issue\n\n\nType of Issue\nWhen a company issues its shares to the public, there are two significant issues, one being Offer for Sale (OFS) and the other one being Fresh Issue. During an OFS, existing company shareholders sell their shares, and no proceeds go to the company. On the other hand, a fresh issue results in all proceeds going to the company. These proceeds are further used to finance the post-IPO plans of the company.\n\n\nReason for IPO\nOne can get an excellent idea about the company, its business model, and the reasons for its IPO from the Red Herring Prospectus. The Draft Red Herring Prospectus, or DRHP, is filed by a company to SEBI when it intends to raise public money by selling company shares to investors. DRHP also elaborates how the company plans to use the funds raised and the possible risks for investors. Thus, investors must go through the DRHP before investing in an IPO.\n\n\nPerformance of the Company\nThe DHRP also has a dedicated section for performance-related matters. It has the company’s previous income statements, balance sheets, and cash flow statements. These can be used to evaluate the financial health of the company as well as make an informed decision before investing in the company.\n\n\nSubscription of the Issue\nAn IPO window is usually open between 4-7 days. This is the duration where investors can bid for the shares. Every IPO has a certain quota reserved for different categories of investors. These divisions are based on the total application amount. Retail investors have an application amount of under ₹2,00,000 (2 lakhs). HNI or High Net Individuals are applications greater than ₹2 lakh, and QIB or Qualified Institutional Buyers are Fund houses, Marquee Investment Companies, pension funds, etc. A retail investor can look for the subscription of QIBs as a crude indication of the success of the IPO."

If you apply for the IPO in the shareholder category, the likelihood of allotment can be higher since most other applicants apply in the retail category. You need to hold 1 share of the parent company to be eligible for the shareholder quota.\n\n\nWhat is ASBA?\nApplications Supported by Blocked Amount (ASBA) is a method developed by SEBI to block the funds for Initial Public Offer (IPO), Rights issue, Follow-on Public Offer (FPO) etc., applications. In ASBA, an IPO applicant’s bank account doesn’t get debited until they receive the allotment of shares."

    "text": "What is an NFT?\nNFT stands for Non-Fungible-Token; non-fungible means something that cannot be exchanged for an item because it is unique. In other words, you can exchange a ₹100 note for another ₹100 note as both have the same value associated with them. Another classic example is a cryptocurrency; 1 Bitcoin can be exchanged for another. Cryptocurrency is fungible, whereas NFTs are not. On the other hand, one piece of artwork is not equal to another; The Mona Lisa is not equal to a Van Gogh’s since both have unique properties. NFTs are tokens that live on a blockchain and represent ownership of unique items. Why do you need a blockchain to do this? Well, tracking a digital file is tricky, as it can be copied and distributed effortlessly. A blockchain comes in handy for ease of tracking ownership and for the value discovery of an asset. Let us take an example to cement our understanding.\nSuppose you made a piece of digital art. You can create a .jpg or mint an NFT out of this. The NFT that represents your art contains information about it, such as\n\nA unique fingerprint ID of the file (Hash)\nToken Name\nToken Symbol\n\nThis token is then stored on the blockchain, and you, the artist, become the owner. To sell the artwork, you create a transaction on the blockchain, and the blockchain makes sure that this information can never be tampered with. It also allows you to track the current owner if the artwork is traded further. In other words, it is a smart contract on the blockchain that stores the unique properties of the asset and keeps track of current and previous owners."

Hydrogen has many different use cases as it is both versatile and transportable. Currently, Hydrogen is used not only as a fuel and storage of energy, but also as a feedstock/raw material in machine or industrial processes.\nSource: Australia's Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization (CSIRO): National Hydrogen Roadmap\nHeat uses: Hydrogen can be used as a source of heat for industrial sectors such as steel, cement, aluminum, paper and building either directly or by blending hydrogen with natural gas to reduce carbon emissions. However, there are some cost challenges for Hydrogen's commercial viability, the carbon prices would still need to be raised to $50–60/tCO2eq for industries like steel and cement and to $160/tCO2eq for space and water heating up to the year 2050 .\nFeedstock uses: Industry chemicals such as plastics, fertilizers and fuel refining and products such as iron, steel, glass, metallurgy, and agriculture require raw materials/feedstock that usually comes from fossil fuels as a part of manufacturing lifecycle and hydrogen could be an alternative.\nFuel uses: Long distance vehicles such as trucks, ships, and airplanes, where the electric battery vehicle technology has faced limitations, could leverage hydrogen powered fuel cell vehicles.\nHydrogen could be used as a source of power by being re-electrified but low levels of efficiency make this type of use case less appealing in the past. Due to recent technological advancements, Hydrogen now has the potential for longer-duration storage of energy, in addition to the flexibility to convert back to electricity if required. Nevertheless, hydrogen cannot currently unlock some sectors, such as long-distance transport pertaining to electrification.\nIn the case of green hydrogen, excess renewable energy that would otherwise have been curtailed (e.g., excess solar energy during the middle of the day) can be stored as hydrogen and released as energy later when required. This enables the ability to store solar energy from the summer to winter months or be used in periods of peak electricity demand.\nAdditionally, the US National Grid has recently secured $12.45 million in funding from the US Department of Energy (DOE) to facilitate research and accelerate the potential of hydrogen blending in its gas networks as a pathway to net carbon zero goal .\nThe global space propulsion market is projected to grow from USD 6.7 billion in 2020 to USD 14.2 billion by 2025, at a CAGR of 16.2% from 2020 to 2025. Similarly, the global hydrogen fuel cell market is forecast to reach USD 848 million by 2025 from an estimated value of USD 263 million in 2020, growing at a CAGR of 26.4% during the forecast period.\nNASA for example has long been relying on hydrogen as the primary rocket fuel for its space exploration activities — delivery of crew and cargo to space (Centaur, Apollo, and other space shuttle vehicles). From these use cases, NASA has both demonstrated and developed extensive experience in the safe and effective handling of hydrogen. Typically, about 500,000 gallons of cold liquid hydrogen (LH2) is needed for the rocket engines of each. The United Launch Alliance (ULA) Atlas Centaur stage rocket, Boeing's Delta III and IV rockets, and Blue Origin's BE-3 and BE-7 engines all use LH2 rocket fuel.\nSource: MarketsandMarkets Research Private Ltd\nIn September 2020, Airbus announced three concepts for the world's first zero-emission (ZEROe) commercial aircraft which could be ready by 2035. All these concepts depend on hydrogen as a primary power source to be a solution for aerospace and many other industries to meet their climate-neutral targets. All three concepts utilize liquid hydrogen fuel to power modified gas turbine aircraft engines. These concepts consist of a set of different approaches to achieve zero-emission flight by exploring various technology pathways and aerodynamic configurations for the decarbonization of the entire aviation industry. The first concept has hydrogen turbofans providing lift for up to 200 passengers with a range of 2,000+ miles. The second concept revolves around a smaller hydrogen turboprop design to carry up to 100 passengers with a range of 1,000+ miles. The third concept is to configure a bold blended-wing body design that offers enhanced flexibility for hydrogen storage and distribution as well as cabin layout .\nNevertheless, the airports will require significant hydrogen transport and refueling infrastructure to meet the needs of day-to-day operations from an infrastructure perspective. Government subsidies and support will be key to further advance the use of sustainable fuels and the renewal of aircraft fleets to allow airlines to retire older, less environmentally friendly aircraft earlier.\nIn addition, the widespread viability of hydrogen for global commercial uses depends on the following factors:\n\nPublic Perception — safety concerns over the usage of hydrogen as it is a highly flammable gas with the heightened risk of explosions. However, the largest addressable focus markets for clean hydrogen are for industrial uses that are hard to electrify and are not consumer-facing.\nTransportation — hydrogen is a low-density gas, which means that the volume to transport the same amount of energy is much higher than natural gas for example. Hence, the higher volumes result in much higher costs for transportation without retrofitting the existing networks of pipe systems used for natural gas. It poses a serious threat for oversea export/import logistics of the gas from cheaper places like Australia to in demand areas such as Japan.\nProduction Cost — fossil fuels can be extracted from earth, but hydrogen must be produced. Hence, the cost of production will take a long time to be cost-competitive and are likely to remain higher unless governments push initiatives such as — strict policies, incentive programs, subsidies, and carbon prices to become the norm .\nInfrastructure — while hydrogen can be used with some existing infrastructure (e.g., gas pipelines), there needs to be significant investments pertaining to infrastructure upgrades."

    "text": "Current situation of hydrogen as energy sources:\nIn 2019, hydrogen demand was 70mt with major use in ammonia synthesis, oil refinery, and steel production; there are not many uses in the energy industry. It is projected to reach nearly 300 mt in 2050.\nCurrently, hydrogen is mainly produced via reforming of natural gas, and the hydrogen is called \"gray\" hydrogen because it is derived from fossil fuels. The process emits up to 2% of total CO2 emission in the world, and because of the higher expectation of hydrogen as a next energy source, a demand for more cleaner ways of producing hydrogen is increasing. If carbon dioxide emitted from the \"gray\" hydrogen production process gets captured before it is released to the atmosphere, the hydrogen is called \"blue\". Nowadays, \"green\" hydrogen has attracted many players; \"green\" hydrogen uses renewable energy to electrolyze water to split hydrogen and oxygen. Now the production cost of grey hydrogen is $1/kg, and the cost of green hydrogen is $3–7.5lkg. Since the cost of renewable energy is getting lower, there is a prediction that the cost of green hydrogen could go down to $2/kg.\n\nMost often this compound is water, which is divided into hydrogen and oxygen.\nIf the electricity used comes from renewable sources, like wind and solar, the subsequent hydrogen is known as \"green.\"\nAccording to the International Energy Agency, less than 0.1% of hydrogen today is produced through water electrolysis, but that could soon change.\nMost of the hydrogen today is used in industry, including oil refining and the production of ammonia, methanol, and steel. But recent advancements in green hydrogen technology are making it much more appealing for several different industries."

    "text": "Future of Impact, ESG, Sustainability\n\nCost\n\nThe key reason green hydrogen hasn't scaled is cost. Right now, it costs $3–7 per kilogram to produce, compared with $1 per kilogram when made with fossil fuels. But three critical factors have aligned in the last year to make it possible to bring that production cost down to between $1 and $2 by 2050.\nFirst, the cost of electrolyzes used to create hydrogen have dropped 50% in the last five years and are expected to fall at least another 60%-90% by 2030, which can start to make green hydrogen competitive to the gray hydrogen used in industries today.7 Falling renewable prices are also key to bringing down hydrogen costs: 60–75% of green hydrogen costs from electricity.\nSeeing technological advances that should further reduce costs by increasing production efficiency and the flexibility of green hydrogen use in fuel cells.\n\n\n\nRegulation\nGovernments across the globe are buying into green hydrogen, which is the most critical incentive for the green hydrogen economy.\n\nIn July 2021, the European Union made its European Hydrogen Strategy the centerpiece of its Green Deal, which in turn was folded into its fiscal stimulus response to the pandemic.\nThe Green Deal is tremendously ambitious and provides an instant source of demand, which is bound to be a catalyst for further innovation and cost reduction, not to mention enormous infrastructure development.\n\nEurope isn't the only place thinking along these lines. Australia, Japan, China, the UK, and Korea all have green hydrogen strategies and/or targets. Sectors we think could be clear beneficiaries include renewable energy, given that demand is likely to grow 10 times by 2050 to service the needs of green hydrogen alone. Utilities will play a role in converting gas grids so that they can carry hydrogen blended with natural gas. Companies that develop electrolyzes and fuel cells stand to benefit, and the chemicals and industrial gases industry is likely to play a large role, given its expertise in using and transporting hydrogen."

Investors can enter or exit at the current net asset value (NAV) throughout the year. These funds are ideal for investors seeking liquidity. E.g., All funds that are not listed on the exchanges.\nClose-Ended Funds: The unit capital to invest is pre-defined in closed-ended funds. The fund company cannot sell more than the pre-agreed number of units. To facilitate liquidity, these funds trade on stock exchanges. E.g., Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs)\nInterval Funds: These are a mixture of both open-ended and close-ended schemes. These funds are open for purchase or redemption only during specific intervals (decided by the fund houses) and are closed the rest of the time. They also have a lock-in period of two years after the initial purchase. These funds are predominantly debt-oriented. E.g. IDFC Yearly Series Interval Fund."

They invest the money pooled from various investors from diverse backgrounds into shares/supplies of different companies. The gains and losses associated with these funds depend solely on how the invested shares perform in the stock market. E.g.: Axis Bluechip Fund\nDebt Funds: They invest in various fixed income instruments such as Fixed Maturity Plans (FMPs), Gilt Funds, Liquid Funds, Short-Term Plans, Long-Term Bonds and Monthly Income Plans, among others. Great for investors looking for passive income over fixed durations. E.g.: Aditya Birla Sun Life Liquid Fund\nHybrid Funds: As the name suggests, Hybrid or Balanced Funds are an optimum mix of bonds and stocks, thereby bridging the gap between equity funds and debt funds.

However, they qualify for tax deductions under Section 80C of the Income Tax Act. They have a minimum investment horizon of three years. E.g., L&T Tax Advantage Fund\nCapital Protection Funds: These funds invest partially in fixed income instruments and into equities. This could ensure capital protection, i.e., minimal loss, if any.

Investors usually park their surplus cash in such funds until they find better investment opportunities. E.g.: Nippon India Ultra Short Duration Fund\nLow-risk Funds: Arbitrage funds are considered low-risk funds. They have minimal exposure to equities and high-risk asset classes. These are best suited for risk-averse investors, and again the returns are 6-8% on average. Eg: Tata Arbitrage Fund\nMedium-Risk Funds: Such funds have considerable exposure to equities. These funds are very similar to index funds and give moderate returns in the range of 9-12% E.g., Kotak Savings Funds\nHigh-Risk Funds: These funds have maximum stock exposure (>95%). The NAV for these funds is volatile too. Moreover, these funds are best suited for young people who have a higher risk appetite. Returns are upwards of 15%, often beating the indexes they track. Some funds also give returns of above 20% E.g., Quant small-cap funds"

They track an index and invest according to the constituents of the same. They are great for investors seeking moderate returns. They may or may not beat the index. E.g., UTI Nifty Index Fund\nFund of Funds: These are special mutual funds that invest in units of other mutual funds. Most global funds available in India are of this type. In short, you are buying a fund that invests in additional diverse funds. E.g., ICICI Prudential Asset Allocator Fund (FoF)\nInternational Funds: These funds invest in companies outside India. Investors seeking international exposure may consider these funds. E.g., Motilal Oswal S&P 500 Index Fund\nExchange-Traded Funds: These belong to the index fund family.

It is believed that all of the gold present in the earth’s crust has been mined; there is very little possibility of finding more reserves of this metal and hence it is deemed to be precious. All the gold available to us today is in circulation and hence there is no ‘store’ from which ‘new’ gold can be added into circulation. This has resulted in gold having tremendous store value and hence is considered very stable in terms of its returns.\nDigital Gold is the new, and much more efficient iteration of storing this lustrous asset.

Digital gold is an online Gold alternative which enables you to hold gold virtually without owning a safe or bank locker. The seller keeps an equivalent weight of physical gold in a secure vault for each online purchase.\nBenefits of Adopting Digital Gold\n\nTaxation: Returns on digital gold assets held for less than 36 months are not strictly taxable. In the case of long-term capital gains, one would have to pay a 20 percent tax on the whole amount, plus a surcharge and a 4% cess with indexation benefits. This is great for investors who want to build an emergency fund in the short to medium term.\nStorage: One does not have to pay bank locker rent, insurance cover or additional investment of Fixed Deposit (FD). The seller promises that the digital gold is stored in an insured, secured vault at no extra cost.\nLiquidity: Digital gold can be sold or redeemed at the click of a button. You can sell the digital gold instantly and the value of your gold is instantly transferred into your bank account through a 24x7 market-linked rate.\nPortfolio Diversification: It is a good investment option for portfolio diversification and a good hedge asset. Making charges: Gold in jewellery form attracts at least 8%, making charges and the price of gold while buying it. This increases the buying cost and depreciation of returns; thus, investors now tend to buy digital gold free from any form of making charges.\nInvest in small amounts: There is no minimum threshold to buy digital gold. One can start investing with as low as INR 10. This surely helps in accumulating assets over a long period of time.\n\nDigital gold is the perfect instrument to begin your investment journey. It is a great way to create robust long-term wealth. One can invest in fractions as low as INR 10 and there is no cap on your investment too."

    "text": "When working with Machine Learning projects, you will come across a wide variety of equations that you need to implement in code. Mathematical notations capture a concept so eloquently but unfamiliarity with them makes them obscure.\nIn this post, I’ll be explaining the most common math notations by connecting it with its analogous concept in Python. Once you learn them, you will be able to intuitively grasp the intention of an equation and be able to implement it in code.\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} (y_i - \\hat{y_i})^2\n\\]\n\n\n\\[\nx_i\n\\]\nThis symbol is taking the value at i\\[^{th}\\] index of a vector.\nx = [10, 20, 30]\ni = 0\nprint(x[i]) # 10\nThis can be extended for 2D vectors and so on. \\[\nx_{ij}\n\\]\nx = [ [10, 20, 30], [40, 50, 60] ]\ni = 0\nj = 1\nprint(x[i][j]) # 20\n\n\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{i=1}^{N} x_i\n\\]\nThis symbol finds the sum of all elements in a vector for a given range. Both lower and upper limits are inclusive. In Python, it is equivalent to looping over a vector from index 0 to index N-1. Notice how we’re using the previously explained \\[x_i\\] symbol to get the value at index.\nx = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nresult = 0\nN = len(x)\nfor i in range(N):\n    result = result + x[i]\nprint(result)\nThe above code can even be shortened using built-in functions in Python as\nx = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nresult = sum(x)\n\n\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{i=1}^{N} x_i\n\\]\nHere we reuse the sigma notation and divide by the number of elements to get an average.\nx = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nresult = 0\nN = len(x)\nfor i in range(N):\n    result = result + x[i]\naverage = result / N\nprint(average)\nThe above code can even be shortened in Python as\nx = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nresult = sum(x) / len(x)\n\n\n\n\\[\n\\prod_{i=1}^{N} x_i\n\\]\nThis symbol finds the product of all elements in a vector for a given range. In Python, it is equivalent to looping over a vector from index 0 to index N-1 and multiplying them.\nx = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nresult = 1\nN = len(x)\nfor i in range(N):\n    result = result * x[i]\nprint(result)\n\n\n\nThe pipe symbol can mean different things based on where it’s applied.\n\n\n\\[\n\\lVert x \\rVert\n\\]\n\\[\n\\lVert y \\rVert\n\\]\nThis symbol denotes the absolute value of a number i.e. without a sign.\nx = 10\ny = -20\nabs(x) # 10\nabs(y) # 20\n\n\n\n\n\\[\n\\lVert x \\rVert\n\\]\nThe norm is used to calculate the magnitude of a vector. In Python, this means squaring each element of an array, summing them and then taking the square root.\nimport math\n\nx = [1, 2, 3]\nmath.sqrt(x[0]**2 + x[1]**2 + x[2]**2)\n\n\n\n\n\\[\n3\\ \\in\\ X\n\\]\nThis symbol checks if an element is part of a set. In Python, this would be equivalent to\nX = {1, 2, 3}\n3 in X\n\n\n\n\\[\nf: X \\rightarrow Y\n\\]\nThis denotes a function which takes a domain X and maps it to range Y. In Python, it’s equivalent to taking a pool of values X, doing some operation on it to calculate pool of values Y.\ndef f(X):\n    Y = ...\n    return Y\nYou will encounter the following symbols in place of X and Y. Here are what they mean:\n\\[\nf: R \\rightarrow R\n\\]\nR means input and outputs are real numbers and can take any value (integer, float, irrational, rational). In Python, this is equivalent to any value except complex numbers.\nimport math\nx = 1\ny = 2.5\nz = math.pi\nYou will also encounter symbols such as\n\\[\nf: R^d \\rightarrow R\n\\]\n\\[R^d\\] means d-dimensional vector of real numbers.\nLet’s assume d = 2. In Python, an example can be a function that takes 2-D array and returns it’s sum. It will be mapping a \\[R^d\\] to \\[R\\]\nX = [1, 2]\nf = sum\nY = f(X)\n\n\n\n\n\n\\[\nX^{\\mathsf{T}}\n\\]\nThis is basically exchanging the rows and columns. In Python, this would be equivalent to\nimport numpy as np\nX = [[1, 2, 3], \n    [4, 5, 6]]\nnp.transpose(X)\nOutput would be a list with exchanged rows and columns.\n[[1, 4], \n [2, 5],\n [3, 6]]\n\n\n\n\\[\nz = x \\odot y\n\\]\nIt means multiplying the corresponding elements in two tensors. In Python, this would be equivalent to multiplying the corresponding elements in two lists.\nimport numpy as np\nx = [[1, 2], \n    [3, 4]]\ny = [[2, 2], \n    [2, 2]]\nz = np.multiply(x, y)\nOutput is\n[[2, 4]],\n[[6, 8]]\n\n\n\n\\[\nxy\n\\]\n\\[\nx \\cdot y\n\\]\nIt gives the sum of the products of the corresponding entries of the two sequences of numbers.\nx = [1, 2, 3]\ny = [4, 5, 6]\ndot = sum([i*j for i, j in zip(x, y)])\n# 1*4 + 2*5 + 3*6\n# 32\n\n\n\n\\[\n\\hat{x}\n\\]\nThe hat gives the unit vector. This means dividing each component in a vector by it’s length(norm).\nimport math\nx = [1, 2, 3]\nlength = math.sqrt(sum([e**2 for e in x]))\nx_hat = [e/length for e in x]\nThis makes the magnitude of the vector 1 and only keeps the direction.\nimport math\nmath.sqrt(sum([e**2 for e in x_hat]))\n# 1.0\n\n\n\n\n\\[\nx!\n\\]\nThis denotes the factorial of a number. It is the product of numbers starting from 1 to that number. In Python, it can be calculated as\nx = 5\nfact = 1\nfor i in range(x, 0, -1):\n    fact = fact * i\nprint(fact)\nThe same thing can also be calculated using built-in function.\nimport math\nx = 5\nmath.factorial(x)\nThe output is\n# 5*4*3*2*1\n120"
